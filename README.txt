To run the script, you'll need to download:

1. The lichess puzzles database (https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles). Provide the path to the download to the "puzzles_datafile" variable. 
2. The stockfish engine (https://stockfishchess.org/). Provide the path to the executable in the move_was_mistake() function definition or the function is called. 
3. The chess modules. You can see a list of dependencies in the requirements file. Note that this list may not be comprehensive and you may need to download more modules.
